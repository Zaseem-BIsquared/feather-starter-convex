# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Developer velocity -- new features are faster to build because every file has a clear, predictable home
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Architecture Modernization

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 1 (Architecture Modernization)
Plan: 4 of 6 in current phase (01-04 complete)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-09 -- Completed plan 01-04 (Feature folder completion and route thinning)

Progress: [██████░░░░] 57%

## Performance Metrics

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 5.0min
- Total execution time: 0.33 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-architecture-modernization | 4/6 | 20min | 5.0min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap revised: consolidated 3 phases into 1 phase with 6 plans
- Plans handle dependency ordering internally (shared infra -> backend -> frontend -> plugin files -> plugins -> generators/docs)
- User preference: minimize manual commands by keeping everything in one phase
- 01-01: Excluded src/routes/** from coverage (routes become thin wrappers)
- 01-01: Used re-export pattern in validators.ts for backward compatibility during migration
- 01-02: Kept all Stripe internal functions in billing/stripe.ts (no separate billing/mutations.ts)
- 01-02: Manually updated _generated/api.d.ts (will be regenerated on next deploy)
- 01-02: cancelCurrentUserSubscriptions is internalAction in billing/stripe.ts
- 01-03: Kept Route.beforeLoad tests importing from original route files (routes not modified until 01-04)
- 01-03: Fixed Element.focus() TS error in feature test copy by casting to HTMLElement
- 01-04: Navigation uses string path constants instead of Route.fullPath imports (breaks circular feature/route dependency)
- 01-04: Coverage excludes barrel exports (index.ts) and Navigation shell (Radix dropdown menus)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Plan 01-02: Convex backend restructure changes ALL api.* paths atomically -- highest risk operation
- Plan 01-02: Must use `convex-helpers/server/zod4` (not `/zod`) for Zod v4 compatibility
- Plan 01-03: TanStack Form Zod v4 adapter compatibility is MEDIUM confidence -- needs hands-on testing
