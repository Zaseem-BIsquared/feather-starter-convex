## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap revised: consolidated 3 phases into 1 phase with 6 plans
- Plans handle dependency ordering internally (shared infra -> backend -> frontend -> plugin files -> plugins -> generators/docs)
- User preference: minimize manual commands by keeping everything in one phase

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Plan 01-02: Convex backend restructure changes ALL api.* paths atomically -- highest risk operation
- Plan 01-02: Must use `convex-helpers/server/zod4` (not `/zod`) for Zod v4 compatibility
- Plan 01-03: TanStack Form Zod v4 adapter compatibility is MEDIUM confidence -- needs hands-on testing
